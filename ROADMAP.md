# ROADMAP

## Introduction
This roadmap outlines the planned improvements and features for the Laravel API application that verifies user information from uploaded files.

## Current State
The application currently accepts file uploads, processes the data, and verifies user information. While the core functionality is in place, there are several opportunities for optimization and expansion.

## Roadmap Overview
- **Error Handling**: Improve error handling by using custom exceptions and Laravelâ€™s built-in error reporting.
- **Caching**: Cache frequently used or computationally expensive verifications to reduce redundant processing.
- **Unit Tests**: Increase unit test coverage.
- **Detailed Reporting**: Generate detailed reports on the verification process, including success/failure rates and error logs.
- **Verification Statistics**: Implement an endpoint that provides statistics on the verification process, such as the number of files processed, success rates, and common validation errors.
- **User Guide**: Create a simple guide explaining how to use the API.
- **Developer Documentation**: Provide documentation on how the code is structured, how to set up a local development environment, and how to extend the application.
- **Monitoring and Logging**: Set up monitoring and logging to track application performance and errors in production.
